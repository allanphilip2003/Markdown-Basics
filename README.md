## **Creation of an ordered List:**

1. List item 1
	1. This is part of list item 1
	1. This is also part of list item 1
2. List item 2
3. List item 3
4. List item 4
5. [types-of-hacking](#types-of-hacking)

*Markdown handles the numbering so we can just name everything 1. and in the preview it will automatically update to the following numbers as shown above in the nested list item 1*

## Addition of a Codeblock:

### Package installer in kali - `sudo-apt install `

## Multiline Codeblock:
```py
print("hello world")
print("123456789")
```
*The above is basically just like what you do in discord*
